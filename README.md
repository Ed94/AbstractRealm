# AnEngine
Unnamed Real-Time Engine (I'll name it later)

So whats the point of this engine?

This is a portfolio piece I want to make. This is not intended to be a full-fledged engine. More so a showcase of what I know in c++

The intention is to use pretty much close to standard c++ style with my own flavoring and really strict taste on spacial alignment of code. I'll do my best to make a super clean design implementation of the structure of the engine but first priority is a working MVP. No optimization, just staright up getting this thing working with the features I want. I'll figure out the rest after.

Whats your references?

Other than what I knew from previous expereince:

This book: 

![Game Engine Architecture, Third Edition](https://i.imgur.com/oMnHm74.png) + More

Documentation for various APIs.

A bunch of Youtube... (I'll note what I used in the wiki)

And more likely more cause this isn't the smallest engine at the same time...

C++17 Used with MSVC. 

(As it stands I'm making the design abstract away from platform implementation but will not be adding support beyond what gets this working on Windows 10)
