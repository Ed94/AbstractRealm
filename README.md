# Abstract Realm
A Real-Time Engine

![Current State](https://i.imgur.com/S8AXDwP.png)

# Dependencies

Vulkan. (Use the VULKAN_PATH env variable). You will also need the debug libs https://files.lunarg.com/.

## So whats the point of this engine?

This is a portfolio piece I want to make. This is not intended to be a full-fledged engine. More so a showcase of what I know in c++

The intention is to use pretty much close to standard c++ style with my own flavoring. I'll do my best to make a clean design implementation of the structure of the engine but first priority is a working MVP. No optimization, just staright up getting this thing working with the features I want. I'll figure out the rest after.

I do also intend on experimenting later on with features I wanted engines to have, so maybe in the future there may be some goodies there.
